# *This is my Learning Journal Rasheed Bader*

Markdown is and easy to use programming language, it helps us turn our normal text into a good-looking webpage, we can create repositories and save our codes and share them with other, our repositories can be edited by us or people who have permission to commit to them.

Markdown has got many different and unique features, it allows us to insert items to our page such as links, images, lists and emojis, we can also add paragraph and edit them or quote sentences, we can style our fonts and change their color as well.

It has also the ability to give references, we can use programmed symbols and tags, also links for repositories are instantly turned into clickable links, to make linking process easy and quick.

I am Rasheed Bader, a coding student with ASAC, I am learning about markdown today, I am happy things are going well :smiley:

-	Make site maps, create a map with divisions or sections of your page
-	Make the wireframe assumption of required space and how content fits on pages
-	Sending precise messages through signals using visual hierarchy, grouping and similarity
•	Visual hierarchy benefits from size, color and unique style making a contrast between main objectives and less important ones.
•	Grouping can be done with proximity, closure, continuance, white spaces, color or boarders these elements make items look as one as they serve the same purpose  
-	Navigation, the design must be concise, clear and selective it must contain interactive and continuous content

Structure:

HTML is structured with tags, each tag has got an opening and closing. Tags here are also semantic as they carry comprehendible meanings similar to human language i.e. <header> <body> <footer> this indicates how html is an easy and organized way to make websites, we can use this to make good-looking websites, we can see how others perform and reflect on good or successful sites to improve our work, we should keep ourselves UpToDate to avoid mistakes, as programming and web development is a community.
III.	17
HTML5 layout:

-	The meaning of the elements
Older html was different from today’s html it used older tags like <div> now we have <header> and <footer> we also have the <nav> tag along with <article>, <aside>, <section>, <hgroup>, <figure>, <figcaption> all of these make an organized environment for our work
 
-	How useful they are
New tags are easy to use and beginner friendly, they make users more comfortable, they indicate their literal meaning or their purpose, they provide clearer codes than before.

-	How do we make sure older browsers recognize them?
Older browsers do not understand block-level elements, also we can get and additional JavaScript to make it work on Internet Explorer 8 for example

CSS what is does? How it works? Rules, properties and values
CSS makes pages attractive; it has the ability to create rules to change how our page looks, from background to titles’ color to paragraphs’ font, these details help us make our work better.
HTML elements must be modified to look nicer, we can add rules to our elements using a code that contains a selector and a declaration example:
 h1 { color:red;
}
This rule affects how h1 is displayed which in this case is displayed in the color red
Now these rules can be added internally in a line or in a command using the code <style>, however it is easier to list them in an external css file and link it to our html and we have some commands such as “rel” “href” that help us add links, after adding them now css treats the html elements as they should appear and controls how they look.

11

We can add colors to elements in css using the color name, the hex codes or the RBG values, there is also the color picking tool which works on other factors like hue, saturation and brightness, to pick good colors we have to avoid basic colors, we must imply the factors of contrast and opacity , colors surely bring life to our work, but they also can brighten the visitor’s  day and make them want to stay more on the page.

The article by Udemy  taught me how to use git hub here are the steps one by one:
1.	Username Configuration with commands:
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
I add my information for GIT and then I'm through
I also can check the settings with the command
$ git config --list
2.	We usually work with our cloned repositories from Github
we can use command
$ git clone https://github.com/Repo
3.	Changes
we can see mark on our editor that indicate modified or unchanged work
4.	Status
5.	we can check status with the command
$ git status
6.	Now the lovely part we always do
Adding to the work with
$ git add *
Then committing our changes 
$ git commit -m “made change x,y,z”
$ git commit -a

Then pushing to gethub
$ git push origin master
7.	I can always review my work with

 Coder's computer:
to start coding you need a text editor to work with or coding program
1.	Editors
text editors come with your original operating system, there is Notepad for example, it is easy to use but it is very basic, this is why they made the Notepad ++ and others, there are also advanced coding programs like VisualStudio which has got many many features, like code completion, extensions and highlighting syntax, and these qualities are what makes a good coding program good, they help the coder in his journey, and make coding modern and easy.
2.	Terminal
the terminal or the command line (CMD) is the face of the system, it visualizes commands for us to see basic, it is shown with a prompt
part of the operating system is what is called the shell it rules how the terminal acts, the one used mostly is called bash
there also many shortcuts used in the terminal that make our work easier
3.	Starting out
to start you can type command
pwd
it shows you Print Working Directory which is your location
to view available directories you can type in
ls
Afterwards we need to type “cd” to go in directories and “cd ..” to go out
4.	Tips 
•	Everything you use in the terminal is created file, so you can’t type in names of files don’t exist in your work place
•	You need to care for files extensions because they differ from one to another
•	You can’t change letter cases for fun Linux won’t work with wrong spelling
•	Spaces between names are not allowed each space has a meaning
