Markdown is and easy to use programming language, it helps us turn our normal text into a good-looking webpage, we can create repositories and save our codes and share them with other, our repositories can be edited by us or people who have permission to commit to them.

Markdown has got many different and unique features, it allows us to insert items to our page such as links, images, lists and emojis, we can also add paragraph and edit them or quote sentences, we can style our fonts and change their color as well.

It has also the ability to give references, we can use programmed symbols and tags, also links for repositories are instantly turned into clickable links, to make linking process easy and quick.

Thank you
